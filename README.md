# CESM-WACCM-Analysis
Code and tools for analysing CESM (WACCM) datasets.

A jupyter notebook has been used to easily display and compare WACCM atmosphere files.

This can be zonal mean plots, lat-lon plots, Earth projection plots, vertical profile plots, etc.

Once you have correctly read in the files (using the drop down menus) after the first 4 cells, then every cell after that should be run through until the final cell which will display the widget.
